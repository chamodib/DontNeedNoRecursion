# DontNeedNoRecursion

In this project, I have implemented a binary search tree without using any recursive functions.
This is a binary search tree, so binary search tree properties are to remains after all insertions and deletions.
Tree was NOT kept short, i.e. simple insertion and deletion were used for this project.
